I was trained as a Theoretical Physicsist at University of Manchester, UK, University of Rostock, Germany and Max Planck Institute Heidelberg, Germany before moving to the field of bio image analysis at Humboldt University, MDC Berlin and Institute Curie, Paris. I am the lead programmer and mantainer of [MTrack](/plugins/mtrack) tool for quantification of mirotubule dynamics (deprecated and replaced by a Napari plugin), [BTrack](/plugins/btrack) tool for quantification of tissue branch morphogenesis, [TrackMate-Oneat](/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-oneat) tool for correcting lineage trees using action classification neural network oneat.

I own a company in Paris called KapoorLabs that specializes in AI based [image analysis](https://www.kapoorlabs.org) and I am currently staff ML engineer in [cognitive science group](https://www.kietzmannlab.org/lab/) at the University of Osnabruck in Germany.
