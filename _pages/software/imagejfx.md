The [ImageJFX](http://www.imagejfx.net/) project aims to create a new user interface for [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) in order to ease scientific image analysis. While keeping the core components of ImageJ2, ImageJFX brings scientists closer to their goal by making the interface clearer for beginners and more practical for advanced users.
