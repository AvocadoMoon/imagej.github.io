N5 is a library and {% include wikipedia title='Application programming interface' text='API'%} for storing large chunked 
n-dimensional tensors and arbitrary meta-data in a hierarchy of groups inspired by {% include wikipedia title='Hierarchical Data Format' text='HDF5'%}. 
It acts as an frontend for a diversity of storage backends, including a simple file-system based implementation, cloud-storage, the HDF5 format,
and the [Zarr format](https://zarr.dev/).

A [Fiji plugin](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-ij) enables:
* image writing with ImageJ using {% include bc path="File | Save As | HDF5/N5/Zarr/OME-NGFF ..." %}
* image reading with {% include bc path="File | Import | HDF5/N5/Zarr/OME-NGFF ..." %}

[Another plugin](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-viewer) lets you open datasets with BigDataViewer with {% include bc path="File | Plugins | HDF5/N5/Zarr/OME-NGFF Viewer" %}.
