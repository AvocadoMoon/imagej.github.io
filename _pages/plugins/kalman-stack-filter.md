## Purpose

This plugin implements a recursive prediction/correction algorithm which is based on the Kalman Filter to remove high gain noise from stacks. It is very useful for noisy time-lapse movies.

## Documentation

The [ImageJ website](https://imagej.net/ij/plugins/kalman.html) offer a very complete documentation for its usage. Please refer to it.
