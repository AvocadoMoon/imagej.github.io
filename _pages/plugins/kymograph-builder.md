## Presentation

*KymographBuilder is Yet Another Kymograph Fiji plugin.*

Features are :

-   Build kymograph from a straight or segmented line (a polyline).
-   Build kymograph for images with multiple channels.
-   Take into account the width of the line using maximum projection along its thickness.
-   Built from scratch and use the ImageJ2 Ecosystem.
-   Fast and easy to use.

How to use :

-   Draw a line: it can be a polyline and you can also set the thickness that will be taken into account by the plugin.
-   Launch KymographBuilder : {% include bc path='Plugins|Kymograph|KymographBuilder'%}
-   You're done.
