FIJI plugin for tracing and analysis of curvilinear structures in volumetric microscopy datasets
(using BigVolumeViewer for visualization).  

At the current moment, it implements 3D ROIs (points, straight/curved lines, planes)
for manual/semi-manual segmentation of lines, curves, and spotty objects.

The plugin is scriptable using ImageJ macros.

For full **documentation** please refer to [project's wiki](https://github.com/ekatrukha/BigTrace/wiki).
