SNT interacts with [Labkit](../labkit) and [Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS)](../tws), both leveraging  machine learning algorithms for semantic segmentation of images (namely, random forest classifiers). The bridge between these tools makes it possible to:

- Import a pre-trained model into SNT and directly load the probability maps of the semantic segmentation as secondary tracing layer
- Train a model with SNT paths

The table below summarizes key differences between Labkit and TWS (as of SNT v4.3.0). Note that both tools classify images using the [Weka framework](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

## Importing Models

<img align="right" width="400" src="/media/plugins/snt/import-weka-model.png" title="Import Models prompt (v4.3.0)" />

Importing of models can be done via the [Secondary layer menu](manual#tracing-on-secondary-image-layer). Once the trained model is imported, it is applied to the image being traced, and the resulting classification is loaded as a secondary tracing image. The import prompt has the following options:

- **Model file**: The file to be imported. Typically, with a .model or .classifier extension (Labkit: JSON-encoded; TWS: XML-encoded)
- **Loading engine**: How the model should be loaded and applied. Either *Labkit*, *Labkit w/ GPU acceleration* or *Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS). NB: Labkit w/ GPU acceleration* expects [CLIJ2](https://clij.github.io/) access, and a CLIJ2-compatible graphics card
- **Load as**: Either *Probability* (p-map) or *Segmented* image. If *Probability image*, the class associated with neurite signal needs to be chosen in a follow-up prompt
- **Display**: Whether the classified image should be immediately displayed. NB: This can be done at anytime using the [View›](./manual#view) menu

## Training Models

To convert traced paths into training labels, simply select the path(s) of interest and run the respective command in the Path Manager's [Process›](manual#process-) menu. This will start up a new instance of Labkit/TWS preloaded with labels generated from selected path(s).
Paths from different channels are split into distinct classification classes 
(i.e., 1 class per channel). Note that there are some (minor) idiosyncrasies in the way Labkit and TWS handle SNT-generated labels:

## Scripts

There are a couple of examples in SNT's neuroanatomy [template collection](scripting#bundled-templates) handling image classification, namely:

- *Apply Weka Model To Tracing Image*: Demonstrates how to apply a pre-existing Weka model to the image being traced
- *Train Weka Classifier*:   Exemplifies how to train a Weka model using traced paths and ROIs
