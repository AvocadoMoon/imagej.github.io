## _Anyone_ Can Contribute to SNT
No matter your skills, academic background, or technical expertise, you can _always_ contribute to SNT! You can report bugs, request features, test new versions, proofread the documentation, answer questions from fellow users, provide tips & tricks, add your own code, or guide future development with your feedback. _You_ are needed to make SNT more capable and easier to use! Here are some things that you can do:

### Cite SNT
This is key. Citations remain the most informative metric of the impact of SNT on scientific research. See [how to properly cite SNT](./faq#how-do-i-cite-snt).

### Join the Forum
This is simple but impactful. Join [forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/), follow the [#snt tag](https://forum.image.sc/tag/snt) and help out by answering questions others may have. When you do so, you are not only paying forward any help you received; you are also allowing developers to focus their time on SNT development.

### Report bugs
Did something fail? Please report it, either on the forum or on GitHub. Don't forget to include a [minimal, complete, verifiable example](/learn/faq#i-reported-an-issue-but-it-is-still-not-fixed-why-not).

### Contribute documentation
Did you notice a typo? Is something unclear or outdated? Are examples missing? Please make a suggestion! Either by following the _Edit this page_ option on the [top](#top) of the page, reaching out on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/snt), or opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/issues). Please don't be shy. All changes are trackable and undoable.

### Reach Out
Get in touch with the [community](https://forum.image.sc/tag/snt) and let us know  how SNT has been useful for your research! You can find the forum handlers of the SNT team on the _Vital statistics_ insert on this page.

### Submit a Script
If you have useful code, it would be great if you could post it on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/snt) or make a [pull request](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/pulls). You could add an example to the [documentation](./scripting) or a script to be [bundled](./scripting#bundled-templates) with the next release. Your code could also be added to the [gallery](./index#overview) to inspire others.

### Improve Core Functionality
Do you have programming experience and a solution for an existing problem? Great! Please file an issue proposing your contribution before submitting a formal pull request to ensure it is not being tackled by someone else.

Would you like to help, but Java is not your thing? That is fine. You should know that Java is not the favorite programming language of SNT developers either. You prefer Python? Julia? R? Great! There is a broad interest in linking SNT functionality to other programming languages (e.g., have a look at [SNT's notebook collection](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/main/notebooks)). Development of SNT follows the same [Fiji's open process](/contribute/fiji#open-development-process). Do [reach out](https://forum.image.sc/tag/snt) with your ideas!
