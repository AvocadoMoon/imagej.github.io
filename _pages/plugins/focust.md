**The goal:** 

To provide an easy-to-use solution for segmenting and relating 3D datasets acquired by fluorescence microscopy in ways that reflect the biological sample. FOCUST provides an interactive optimization mode to configure segmentation parameters and numerous analysis modes to relate and manage data in a biologically meaningful way.
