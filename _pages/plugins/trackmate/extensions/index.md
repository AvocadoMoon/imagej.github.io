[TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) is made to be extended thanks to its modular structure.
We and several others have also developed other plugins that depend on TrackMate and extend its functionality.
We document some of them here.

- The [TrackMate Helper](trackmate-helper): A tool that is used to measure tracking performance and optimize tracking settings based on the metrics defined in the Single-Particle-Tracking challenge and the Cell-Tracking challenge.

- [TrackMate ONeat](trackmate-oneat) by Varun Kapoor, and extension that can detect cell divisions based on a machine learning process.

- The [TrackMate CSV Importer](csv-importer): a plugin to import detections from a CSV table into TrackMate.

- [Find Maxima detector](find-maxima-detector): a detector that used the 'Find maxima' command of ImageJ to detect objects. By Thorsten Wagner.
