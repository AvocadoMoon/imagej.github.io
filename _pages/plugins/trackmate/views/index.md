Views are [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) modules that can display the tracking results in various shapes and forms.
These modules regroup the default track display, the TrackScheme tool and the tables.

## Views

- The [HyperStack viewer](hyperstack-viewer): display the tracks over the image data in the ImageJ view.
- [TrackScheme](trackscheme): the lineage viewer and editor for TrackMate.
- The [spots and tracks tables](tables): the several tables that display the feature values for all the TrackMate objects.
- The [grapher](grapher): a plotting tool for TrackMate feature values.

## Display settings

[This page](trackmate-display-settings) explains what display settings are supported in the several views shipped with TrackMate, and where they are saved.
