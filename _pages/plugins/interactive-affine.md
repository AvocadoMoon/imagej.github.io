This plugin allows to apply a **free affine transformation** to a 2D image in an interactive way.

**Premises**: You need an image to be open.

**Use**:

1.  When calling the plugin, **three points** (represented as yellow PointRois) will be displayed on the image.
2.  Drag and drop the points to interactively transform the image with an **affine model**.
3.  If you are satisfied with the result, press ENTER, otherwise, press ESC.
